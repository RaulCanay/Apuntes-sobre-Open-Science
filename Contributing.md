\# Contribution Guidelines

 

\*\*New to GIT and GitHub?\*\* See [these learning
resources](https://help.github.com/articles/git-and-github-learning-resources/)
and this [10 min. GIT tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1).

 

These are the main contributing guidelines for the development of this MOOC, and
apply to each module within. The development structure for this is based on a
combination of two things:

 

\* Invited experts as part of a core development team, led by one or two
managers for each module.

\* Open participation, where anyone can contribute using the standard processes
on GitHub.
